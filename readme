Source Files
==================================================================

The only source files:

							claire.c

Extra Credit
==================================================================

What other signal has this property?
-- 17 SIGSTOP stop (cannot be caught or ignored)

Which manpage has this information?
-- signal(2)

-- Parsing implemented (+5 pts)


Compilation instructions
==================================================================

In the directory of the source files type

	make


Overview of work accomplished
==================================================================

I wrote code for a shell little program! I also compiled the linux
kernel and added a syscall for Project 1. Yay!



Description of code and code layout
==================================================================

My code is laid out with a sigHandler and a loop which parses
and executes input. nosigAlrm is a flipping bit that saves state
for outputting correct messages regarding kill. I named my shell 
after my new daughter. She will be born at the end of May!

"Dirty diaper eradicated!" = process killed
"Diaper change failed! Baby is crying." = process escapes


General comments and anything that can help us grade your code
==================================================================

Please do not grade me down for including string library. I only
used it to add on the extra feature of exiting gracefully when
the user types "exit".


Hours spent & level of effort required
==================================================================

I spent 20+ hours on this project. It required a lot of effort.
